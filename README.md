# zoidberg_software

This is the channel for the zoidberg software team.

As most of the software team is new to github, this repository gives our software team a platform to write and share files with each other.

Please use this channel to share helpful code with your fellow software teammates. This could be some interesting code you found on the internet or code that you've been working on during the week. Remember to comment your code as much as possible to make it easier for everyone to understand what's going on!
