All are welcome. This is repository for the SD City Robotics software team, mainly for first-time members who are new to OpenCV, Python or programming in general!

As most of the software team will be new to GitHub, this repository gives our software team a platform to write and share files with each other. There are a lot of resources online explaining how to use GitHub, so be sure to check those out.

Please use this channel to share helpful code with your fellow software teammates. This could be some interesting code you found on the internet or code that you've been working on during the week. Remember to comment your code as much as possible to make it easier for everyone to understand what's going on!
