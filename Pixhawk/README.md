The Pixhawk is a gernel perpose PWM controller with built in features. We will not bei using the full set of features but some are mandatory for most of the uses(Land, Water, Air)

For our use case we will be using the Pixhawk as a general use submersible. For this we will be using the [ARDUSUB](https://www.ardusub.com/) branch of [Ardupilot](https://docs.px4.io/v1.9.0/en/flight_controller/pixhawk_series.html).

The use case for our pixhawk or any exploration ,with the pixhawks capabilities is to further understand the capabilities of AUV submersibles underwater


For our initial wiring we test the motor controls, this is symbolic to our production tests these may be simplified or expanded.
